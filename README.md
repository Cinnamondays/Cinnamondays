- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cinnamondays
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics, 3D sculpting, boardgames, video games, pnp games, space, fantasy, and science fiction.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning beginners Data Analytics stuff, so mostly SQL, Python, and R.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - nothing right now, but I hope I can contribute more once I've learned more.
- 📫 How to reach me - good question! I'll have to come back to this one.
